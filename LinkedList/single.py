# key concepts:

# dummy: This is a placeholder node at the start of your merged list. It doesn't hold meaningful data; it's just there to simplify the logic.
# tail: This is a moving pointer that always points to the last node in your merged list as you build it.
# Why dummy.next Returns the Whole List
# dummy always points to the start of your merged list (the placeholder node).
# dummy.next points to the real head of your merged list (the first actual data node).
# When you return dummy.next, you return the entire merged list (excluding the dummy node).
# Why tail.next Might Only Return 4
# tail moves as you build the list. At the end, tail points to the last node (which, in your example, has value 4).
# tail.next is None (since it's the end of the list), or if you set it to something else, it could point to a single node.
# So, returning tail.next gives you only what's after the last nodeâ€”usually nothing, or just the last node if you made a mistake.
# Analogy
# Think of dummy as a coat hanger and tail as your hand moving along the clothes as you hang them. At the end, your hand is at the last shirt, but the hanger still holds the whole row.

# Example
# Suppose you have this code:

# Summary
# Return dummy.next to get the full merged list.
# Return tail.next only gives you what's after the last node (usually nothing).
# Let me know if you want to see a code example!
